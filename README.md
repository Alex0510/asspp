- This installation method does not register the software with the App Store, so it cannot auto-update. Manual updates can retain data, but subsequent installations cannot use this software, and this method cannot overwrite existing apps.

## 🚀 Usage

# iPhone

- Visit the Releases page (https://github.com/Lakr233/Asspp/releases) and download the latest Asspp.ipa
- Re-sign the IPA with a signing tool, then install it
- Or use this Shortcut: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d3c28f125b724a2da136d560fcf360dc
  > Copy the link and run it, or add the shortcut to your share sheet; when opening the link choose "Open in Sidestore"

# Mac

- Visit the Releases page (https://github.com/Lakr233/Asspp/releases) and download the latest Asspp.zip
- Unzip and open Asspp.app

### First Run and Trusting the App (Recommended)

1. Try double-clicking to open the app. If you see "App can’t be opened because the developer cannot be verified" or a similar message:
   - In Finder, locate Asspp.app, Control-click (or right-click) the app and choose "Open", then click "Open" again in the dialog. This will create a one-time trust exception for the app.
2. If Control-clicking does not work or the app is still blocked:
   - Open System Settings -> Privacy & Security (or System Preferences -> Security & Privacy on older macOS). In the General/Security section, look for the blocked app and click "Open Anyway" or "Allow". You may need to enter an administrator password.
3. Recommendation: Download from this repository's Releases and verify the release details to ensure the source is trusted before trusting and opening the app.

> These steps follow macOS Gatekeeper practices and help minimize security risks while allowing you to run unsigned or self-signed apps.
